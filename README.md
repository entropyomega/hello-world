# hello-world
a short description

//these changes are for the github hello-world tutorial

Hello, I am interested in developing AI and machine learning. I am learning to code so that I can contribute meaningful changes to AI and machine learning development.

I also have a home lab, and it is down right now, because I have nothing to compute with its computational might, maybe I will just set it to mine coin and fold at home for now.
